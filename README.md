# laundry-reservation
A mock laundry reservation system for an apartment complex.

This project was completed as part of a college software development course. 
The purpose of this project was to test us on our ability to work with a group, 
design a system using SDLC concepts, and actually create a funnctional piece of software using the skills we have learned throughout the course including PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JS.

The concept of the project is to design a system and create a website for an apartment complex of 25 tenants who have to share one laundry room, that allows tenants to reserve a 3-hour time slot.
Each tenant can only reserve one timeslot per week, and can not change their timeslot once they have reserved one.
